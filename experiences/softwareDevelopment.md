# Software Development Experience

## Languages

Im most familiar with c# and typescript.

##### C-Sharp (c#,cs)

C# was my primary language for ~3 years.

Initially while dabbling with [Unity](https://unity.com/) I was exposed to it for the first time.

Since then I used this language actively at work. There I did major contributions towards a system for selling goods using Ebays soap based Trading API. Afterwards I maintained and extended the backend part of this [project in production](https://www.ebay.de/str/derersatzteileprofi) over a timespan of 2 years.

At this time I read through most of [Microsofts C# documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/sk-sk/dotnet/csharp/) in order to apply a better structure to the mammoth of a codebase, that said project was.

Afwerwards I specialised in Rest APIs, as I wrote my final apprenticeship project about this exact topic. There I used Microsofts MVC Web API Framework using its cross platform version .NET 6.

This has become my most used project framework since then and I tried to steadily adopt more business practices and standards with the help of videos by [Nick Chapsas](https://nickchapsas.com/). I also learned a lot about Design Patterns in the process.

##### Typescript (ts)

Typescript has become a top contender for my favourite language since early 2022. Its flexible cascading generic Types were way too utility-rich for me to ignore its existence any further.

I originally became interested in it while searching for a way to visualize content from my Web APIs, as I steadily learned more about REST APIs. Little Reasearch showed, that learning React.ts + Redux was the prefered way to resolve my problems.

In order to start my journey into the modern world of frontends, I decided to watch courses on [code with mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/). I learned how to create React Applications using Typescript, how to properly manage state using Redux/React-Contexts and how to create cross device-class compatible Applications using React-Native. To aid the learning effect of those courses, I created serveral frontend projects, in which I was very involved in at the time.

Unfortunately my desire to make anything generic and reusable held me back from completing any of those projects. I definitely learned a lesson from that nevertheless.

After working on a startup project for 200h+, implementing & abstracting redux toolkit, working with hooks and simply spending huge amounts of braincapcity on this language, I feel way more comfortable with it. 

##### Python (py)

We ironically used this language to learn object oriented programming in business school. Since then I adopted this language for use in exams only, as those are apperantly still written on üìÑ in schools & uni...

Anyways... I would like to practice it with regards to jupyter notebooks in the future...

##### PHP (php)

While Im not exactly proud of knowing this language at all, I used it quite a bit during my apprenticeship.

I initially got to know this language during 8th or 9th grade in informatics class. There we recreated serveral sorting algorithms using this language and did primitive websites.

At the beginning of my apprenticeship I was assinged to a project together with a colleague. Essentially we were supposed to create a system to manage IT supplies and create maps of their storage and usage locations. As I was not familiar with using frameworks and libraries at the time, I wrote my own SPA framework using AJAX calls from scratch using PHP and vanilla Javascript. The project then proceeded growing into other levels of complexity as more and more features were added daily. In the end, after almost one year of work, the project was unfortunately scrapped, because the testing team refused to interact with the system. The major reason for this was a similar system, they already purchased, that covered all of their needs. RIP ATPInventory... ‚ò†Ô∏è

During the last year of my apprenticeship I was part of a team, which created a new alternative for the companys Online Shop. I was introduced into this project, which was based on the PHP framework OpenCart. Eventhough my part was limited to a single module, I extended the basic functionality of said framework in order to allow for communications (configuration merges) between multiple versions of these kinds of hosted development environments. In the end I didnt experience the completion of this project, as I left said company.

Afterwards I proceeded not to interact with this language ever again.

##### JavaScript (js)

As already mentioned before, JavaScript was a big part of probably the most time intensive project I ever worked on. Therefore Im very familiar with vanilla JavaScript. My biggest achievent using vanilla Javascript at the time was creating a webbased alternative to Microsoft Visio, that was integrated into said application.

Whenever i learned Typescript Redux, I was confronted with functional Javascript. Watching courses on [code with mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/) helped enormously at the time, as I have never been confronted with this paradigm before. Functional programming became a big part of future improvements to my style of writing code, as I adopted more and more patterns like fluent Interfaces and the strategy pattern.

##### C++ (cpp)

##### Java (java)

Initially I was not convinced by java, as it seemed to be almost identical to c# to me at first.
However, discovering the enterprice ecosystem behind gradle & spring and practiciing it tirelessly in conjunction with programming practices made me question my original stance.
