## Experience

During the last few years I build a very wide understanding of most IT topics.

### Languages

Most common languages are familiar to me syntactically. Some of them are especially well known to me.

##### C-Sharp (c#,cs)

Its save to say, that people deem C# to be my primary language.

Initially while dabbling with Unity (https://unity.com/) I was exposed to it for the first time.

Since then I used this language actively at work. There I did major contributions towards a system for selling goods using Ebays soap based Trading API. Afterwards I maintained and extended the backend part of this project (https://www.ebay.de/str/derersatzteileprofi) in production over a timespan of 2 years.

At this time I read through most of https://learn.microsoft.com/sk-sk/dotnet/csharp/ in order to apply a better structure to the mammoth of a codebase, that said project was.

Afwerwards I specialised in Rest APIs, as I wrote my final apprenticeship project about this exact topic. There I used Microsofts MVC Web API Framework using its cross platform version .NET 6.

This has become my most used project framework since then and I tried to steadily adopt more business practices and standards with the help of videos by https://nickchapsas.com/. I also learned a lot about Design Patterns in the process.

##### Typescript (ts)

Typescript has become a top contender for my favourite language since early 2022. Its flexible cascading generic Types where way too utility-rich for me to ignore its existence any further.

I originally became interested in it while searching for a way to visualize content from my Web APIs, as I steadily learned more about REST APIs. Little Reasearch showed, that learning React.ts + Redux was the prefered way to resolve my problems.

In order to start my journey into the modern world of frontends, I decided to watch Courses on https://codewithmosh.com/. I learned how to create React Applications using Typescript, how to properly manage state using Redux/React-Contexts and how to create cross device-class compatible Applications using React-Native. To aid the learning effect of those courses, I created serveral frontend projects, in which I was very involved in at the time.

Unfortunately my desire to make anything generic and reusable held me back from completing any of those projects. I definitely learned a lesson from that nevertheless.

##### Python (py)

While I did not use this language to create a business application using a framework like django yet, I think I know how to do so, as I tried Django once.

We ironically used this language to learn object oriented programming in business school. Since then I adopted this language for use in class tests only, as those are apperantly written on üìÑ in schools...

I also took a sneak peak into the world of Jupyter Notebooks. At this time I became very interested in Data Science using notebooks with Tensorflow doing some basic Mashine Learning. I never praticed this consistently yet though, as Im missing a bit of knowledge about higher math functions and systems. Im looking forward to get to know those things at the university.

##### PHP (php)

While Im not exactly proud of knowing this language at all, I used it quite a bit during my apprenticeship.

I initially got to know this language during 8th or 9th grade in informatics class. There we recreated serveral sorting algorithms using this language and did primitive websites.

At the beginning of my apprenticeship I was assinged to a project together with a colleague. Essentially we were supposed to create a system to manage IT supplies and create maps of their storage and usage locations. As I was not familiar with using frameworks and libraries at the time, I wrote my own SPA framework using AJAX calls from scratch using PHP and vanilla Javascript. The project then proceded growing into other levels of complexity as more and more features were added daily. In the end, after almost one year of work, the project was unfortunately scrapped, because the testing team refused to interact with the system. The major reason for this was a similar system, they already purchased, that covered all of their needs. RIP ATPInventory... ‚ò†Ô∏è

During the last year of my apprenticeship I was part of a team, which created a new alternative for the companys Online Shop. I was introduced into this project, which was based on the PHP framework OpenCart. Eventhough my part was limited to a single module, I extended the basic functionality of said Framework in order to allow for communications (Configuration Merges) between multiple versions of this kind of hosted development environments. In the end I didnt experience the completion of this project, as I left said company.

Afterwards I proceeded not to interact with this language ever again.

##### JavaScript (js)

As already mentioned before, JavaScript was a big part of probably the most time intensive project I ever worked on. Therefore Im very familiar with vanilla JavaScript. My biggest achievent using vanilla Javascript at the time was creating a webbased alternative to Microsoft Visio, that was integrated into said application.

Whenever i learned Typescript Redux, I was confronted with functional Javascript. Watching Courses by https://codewithmosh.com/ helped enormously at the time, as I have never been confronted with this paradigm before. Functional programming became a big part of future improvements to my style of writing code, as I adopted more and more systems like fluent Interfaces and the strategy pattern.

##### C++ (cpp)

##### Java (java)

Well, as everybody else already said before, its just like C#. While this is not exactly true, there a lot of equal syntax elements. For some weird reason, its still the prefered way to teach object oriented programming to students around the world.

Eventough ive never tried to use Spring in enterprice projects, it seems to be similar to ASP.NET, Rails and Django. Therefore I predict a very shallow learning curve, if it ever comes down to getting to know it.

### Encompassing Projects

##### VibeChecker (Idea, Maslov)

##### Valremsharca (Dotnet)

##### Project Manager (Dotnet,React)

##### Beardy (Mustache)

##### MetaCode/Layer8 (Idea,Polyglot)

### Homelab

My homelabbing experience has been [erratic](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=erratic) to say the least. As I researched certain topics my interest repeatedly shifted spontaneously throughout the years.

##### Topology

##### Bare Metal

I received my first server from a family friend as a gift. Its a **Fujitsu Primergy Tower** with the following specs:

```
CPU: Intel¬Æ Xeon¬Æ CPU E3-1226 v3
Mainboard: FUJITSU D3219-A1
Storage: 2x Seagate ST1000DM003
```

Additionally i received my families old **FritzBox 7490** to use freely. Unfortunately its operatingsystem is irreplaceable, so it cannot be used as a router or layer3 switch in a professional scense. Eventhough this is the case, it can still be used a WIFI Access Point.

At one point in time, I decided to purshase a **Raspi** as a utility server or IOT device. I never realy regreted this deciscion.

```
Device: Rasberry PI Model 4b
Memory: 4GB
Storage: San Disk 32gb microSD card
```

While I was all in for upgrading my gaming rig at some other point in time, I was left with spare hardware parts, which I deemed to be worthwhile the little effort, to assembly **a secondary tower server** out of them.

```
Mainboard: Asus H81M-PLUS
CPU: Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i5-4590
```

I will add my own **gaming rig** in here as i (mis)used it as a VM-Host for quite some time aswell.

```
Mainboard: Asus X570F Gaming
CPU: Ryzon 3700x
RAM: 32gb G.Skill Aegis DDR4-3200
GPU: RTX 2070 SUPER
lighting: sick
```

Amongst many other things, I also possess 2 cheap Ethernet switches and two 1-Port and a 2-Port Gigabit NIC, which i make use of frequently.

##### Virtualization
